# Getting Started
## Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*) is the official software for writing and uploading code to Arduino boards.

### Features

- Simple text editor for writing code.
- Built-in serial monitor for communication.
- Easy upload of sketches to the board.

!!! note
    The IDE supports multiple boards and libraries.

### Installing the IDE

Download the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Writing and Uploading Code

Write your code in the editor and click the **Upload** button to send it to your Arduino board.

!!! note
    Make sure the correct board and port are selected before uploading.

## Connecting Arduino

To connect your Arduino board to your computer, use a USB cable. The USB connection provides both power and data transfer.

* Make sure your board is properly seated and the cable is securely connected.
* The Arduino IDE will automatically detect the board if drivers are installed.

!!! note
    If your board is not detected, check the cable and try a different USB port.

Once connected, you can upload sketches (programs) to the board using the Arduino IDE.

### Selecting the Board and Port

In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Board** and select your Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno). Then go to **Tools > Port** and select the correct COM port.

!!! note
    The COM port may change if you unplug and replug the board.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure drivers are installed.
- Try restarting the IDE.
- Use a different USB cable or port.
